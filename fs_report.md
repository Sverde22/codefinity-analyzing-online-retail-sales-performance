-e This file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combined into a single document

## Purpose
This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

## File Format
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A header with the file path (## File: path/to/file)
  b. The full contents of the file in a code block or first three lines for files with .csv extensions

## Usage Guidelines
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

## Notes
- This file includes only .ipynb and .csv file contents in full or partial form
- All other file types are represented only through the directory structure
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
